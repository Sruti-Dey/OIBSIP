# Java Developement Internship
This repository contents my completed tasks given by OASIS INFOBYTE during my 4 weeks Java Development Internship.
# Task 1: Online Reservation System
This Online Reservation System will Include all the necessary fields which are required during online reservation system. This system will be easy to use and can be used by any person. This system can view the availablility of seats in a train, can reserve seat and generate PNR number and can cancel any reservation by using the PNR number.
# Task 2: Number Guessing Game
The fun and easy project “Guess the Number” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps: The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guessed number or it is higher/lower than the generated number. The game continues under the user guessing the number.After successfully guessing the number a score will be displayed on the screen.
